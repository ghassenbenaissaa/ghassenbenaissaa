# Hi ,I'm Ghassen✨

I'm a software engineer passionate about Java and DevOps, dedicated to integrating the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) into my projects. I consistently aim to implement at least one SDG to contribute to a more sustainable future. 🚀 I'm open to collaborating on innovative projects where I can both contribute my expertise and learn from others. 💡 Feel free to ask me about my projects or interests—I'm always happy to discuss both technical and non-technical topics. 😎
